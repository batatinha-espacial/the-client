# HTML Global Attribute - dir

The dir globbal attribute indicates the directionality of the element's text.<br>
It can have the following values:
- `ltr`: left to right, it's used for languages that are written from the left to the right (like English).
- `rtl`: right to left, it's used for languages that are written from the right to the left (like Arabic).
- `auto`: lets the user agent decide. It uses a basic algorithm as it parses the characters inside the element until it finds a character with a strong directionality, then applies that directionality to the whole element.
