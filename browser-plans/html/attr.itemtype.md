# HTML Global Attribute - itemtype

The global attribute itemtype specifies the URL of the vocabulary that will be used to define itemprop's (item properties) in the data structure.<br>
itemscope is used to set the scope of where in the data structure the vocabulary set by itemtype will be active.<br>
Google and other major search engines support the schema.org vocabulary for structured data. This vocabulary defines a standard set of type names and property names. For example, MusicEvent indicates a concert performance, with startDate and location properties specifying the concert's key details. In this case, MusicEvent would be the URL used by itemtype, with startDate and location as itemprop's which MusicEvent defines.
