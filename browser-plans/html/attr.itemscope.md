# HTML Global Attribute - itemscope

itemscope is a boolean global attribute that defines the scope of associated metadata. Specifying the itemscope attribute for an element creates a new item, which results in a number of name-value pairs that are associated with the element.<br>
A related attribute, itemtype, is used to specify the valid URL of a vocabulary (such as schema.org) that describes the item and its properties context. In each of the following examples, the vocabulary is from schema.org.<br>
Every HTML element may have an itemscope attribute specified. An itemscope element that does not have an associated itemtype must have an associated itemref.
