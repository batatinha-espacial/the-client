# We need people!

We need people for helping me to build the web browser and/or the basic clients. DM me on discord: `antonio_breno`<br>
All the project is built on C++, using `gtk` and `boost`.<br>
All you need to know to colaborate is a little of web development and/or the languages and libraries listed above.

## The browser

It's our biggest project inside `the-client`. It has these 4 principles:
- Support what is already supported on modern web browsers.
- Support deprecated technologies, for rendering old websites for example.
- Support natively other web technologies not supported by normal browsers.
- Make a revolution on modern web standards with exclusive features.
